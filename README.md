# 👋 Hi, I'm Ben — Web Developer in Training  
### Detail-driven · Systems-minded · Transitioning from healthcare into tech

I'm a self-taught web developer with a background in **laboratory operations, medical call centers, and hospitality management**.  
Across all of those roles, one thing has stayed constant:  
I love breaking down complex systems, simplifying processes, and building experiences that actually help people.

I’m now channeling that into front-end web development — with a growing focus on accessibility, clean UI, and thoughtful UX.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools
**Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Currently Learning:** Responsive design, DOM manipulation, accessibility best practices, Git/GitHub workflows  
**Upcoming Goals:** Data analytics foundations, React, and stronger JS project patterns  

---

## 🧠 What I Bring to Tech  
Before transitioning into development, I spent years working in high-pressure, detail-critical environments:

- **Night-shift laboratory tech** — precision, quality control, and reliability  
- **Medical call center supervisor** — documentation accuracy, system building, training  
- **Hotel event management** — translating client needs into executable workflows  

These roles strengthened the same qualities that make a great developer:  
**attention to detail, clarity in communication, pattern recognition, problem-solving, and the ability to build systems that work.**

## 🚧 Featured Projects  
A few things I’m currently building or refining:

### 🌿 **Healing Dancescapes**  
A multi-page website designed for a dance meditation instructor.  
Includes service descriptions, responsive layouts, contact form, navigation redesign, gallery page, consistent styling system, and interactive JS elements.

> Focus areas: accessibility, user flow, responsive design, clean commit history.

### 🗂️ Portfolio & Practice Projects  
Early JavaScript and DOM-based experiments as I build toward a more complete portfolio.

I’m actively refining these to improve:
- readable code  
- structured components  
- better naming conventions  
- mobile-first responsiveness  
- accessibility  

More polished projects coming soon as my coding journey continues.

## 🌱 Currently Working On
- Building out consistently styled, professional repositories  
- Writing cleaner README files and documentation  
- Improving UI/UX instincts through practice and iteration  
- Completing JavaScript certification (freeCodeCamp)  
- Strengthening Git workflows and commit discipline  

---

## 🚀 The Goal  
I’m transitioning into tech at nearly 40 — intentionally.  
I’m looking for **stable, behind-the-scenes roles** that value structure, independence, attention to detail, and long-term growth.

Front-end development feels like the right fit — and I’m building toward a role where I can contribute to clean, accessible interfaces and thoughtful user experiences.
